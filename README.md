# Conduit Connector Azure Storage

## General

The Azure Storage plugin is one of [Conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit) plugins.
It currently provides only source connector.

## How to build it

Run `make`.

## Source

The Source connector monitors given Azure Blob container for file changes and generates appropriate Record when change is detected.
It supports two reading modes and switches them automatically:
- Snapshot
- CDC

In **Snapshot mode**, connector reads the current state of the container, meaning it does not include changes made during this process.
When interrupted, after restarted, it iterates all over container again.

After Snapshot reading is finished, connector switches to **CDC mode**.
In this mode, connector monitors the container each `pollingPeriod` period and notifies about changes detected.
The iterator stores the last modification timestamp of the files iterated in the previous cycle. When detecting new changes, this timestamp is used to discard files created before it.
When interrupted, after restarted, it iterates using the timestamp stored in sdk.Position, passed to source's Open method.

Both iterators paginate over the container via [List Blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs) query, with up to `maxResults` items per page, to read the list of available items and their metadata (`Last-Modified` and `Content-Type`).
When creating the sdk.Record, the contents of the file is additionally requested via [Get Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob) query.

### Supported storage changes

Changes regarding adding new files to the storage or updating the existing ones are always detected.
However, [soft delete for blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-enable) needs to be enabled to detect deleted files.

### Configuration Options

| name               | description                                                                                                                            | required | default  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| `connectionString` | Azure Storage connection string as described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string | `true`   |          |
| `containerName`    | The name of the container to monitor.                                                                                                  | `true`   |          |
| `pollingPeriod`    | The polling period for the CDC mode, formatted as a time.Duration string. Must be greater then `0`.                                    | `false`  | `"1s"`   |
| `maxResults`       | The maximum number of items, per page, when reading container's items. The minimum value is `1`, maximum value is `5000`.              | `false`  | `"5000"` |

## Testing

Run `make test` to run all the unit and integration tests, which require Docker to be installed and running. The command
will handle starting and stopping docker containers for you.
